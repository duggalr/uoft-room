            Who's going to be in my CSC207 class this coming fall semester? Which students have done an internship at the 
            WWF organization? Any other people on campus listen to the 'Highway Robbery' band? Who's trying to be on my 
            basketball intramural team this semester?
            <br/><br/>
            When Facebook first started, these were the types of questions one could easily find answers too. 
            However, <i>zuck (kinda) screwed it all up...</i>
            <br/><br/>
            This isn't necessarily a replica of the 2004 (the)facebook. And I'm not saying answers to the above questions 
            can't be found leveraging existing social tools (i'm not from the stone age, even though the UI of this site might convince 
            you otherwise). I feel in general though, there (shockingly) doesn't really seem to be a medium on the web that captures
            the social dynamics of a college campus with real-identity...
            <br/><br/>
            I quickly created this website as an experiment to see if students would join the party... 
            who knows, I could be completely wrong and this is the most useless piece-of-shit 
            website you have ever seen and you absolutely never want to meet me (given the campus size and current state of the web (ahem), 
            that's very likely anyways) but hey, I'm willing to roll the dice.
