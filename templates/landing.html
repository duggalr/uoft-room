      The Uoft Room is an online directory for current UofT students and alumni. You can create your 
      online profile, link your social media accounts, and find/connect with other students on campus.
      It is only available if you have a valid uoft email 
      <br/><br/>

      <strong>It can be used to: </strong>
      <ul class="ui list">
        <li>Find people who are taking the same classes as you this coming semester</li>
        <li>Find people who share some common interests</li>
        <li>Connect with a grad student who is in a program you want to be in</li>
        <li> <span style="font-size: 16px;">&#128064;</span> <i>(you'll get it if you join...)</i></li>
      </ul>

      Who's going to be in my CSC207 class this coming fall semester? Which students have done an internship at the 
      WWF organization? Any other people on campus listen to the 'Highway Robbery' band? Who's trying to be on my 
      basketball intramural team this semester?
      <br/><br/>
      When Facebook first started, these were the types of questions one could easily find answers too. 
      However, <i>zuck (kinda) screwed it all up...</i>
      <br/><br/>
      This isn't necessarily a replica of the 2004 (the)facebook. And I'm not saying answers to the above questions 
      can't be found leveraging existing social tools (i'm not from the stone age, even though the UI of this site might convince 
      you otherwise). I feel in general though, there (shockingly) doesn't really seem to be a medium on the web that captures
      the social dynamics of a college campus with real-identity...
      <br/><br/>
      I quickly created this website as an experiment to see if students would join the party...
      the initial version is quite minimal and predicated more so on profiles and finding other students on campus.
      <br/><br/>
      who knows, I could be completely wrong and this is the most useless piece-of-shit 
      website you have ever seen and you absolutely never want to see or meet me (given the campus size and current state of the web (ahem), 
      that's very likely anyways) but hey, I'm willing to roll the dice.
